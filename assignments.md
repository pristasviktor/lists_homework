# Programming Exercises

This document contains eight programming exercises. Each exercise includes a description of the task and, where necessary, examples to clarify the requirements.

---

## Exercise 1: Check if the given list is sorted
Write a function that checks if a given list of numbers is sorted in ascending order (from smallest to greatest). The function should return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise.

### Example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Output: `True`

- Input: `[5, 3, 2, 1]`
- Output: `False`

---

## Exercise 2: Swap values at two indexes
Write a function that swaps the values at two specified indexes in a given list. The function should modify the original list.

### Example:
- Input: `list = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, `idx1 = 1`, `idx2 = 3`
- Output: The list becomes `[10, 40, 30, 20]`.

---

## Exercise 3: Greatest difference between neighbors
Write a function that calculates the greatest absolute difference between two neighboring elements in a list. The function should return this maximum difference.

### Example:
- Input: `[1, 3, 7, 2, 8]`
- Output: `6` (difference between `8` and `2`)

---

## Exercise 4: Find the index of the maximum value
Write a function that finds and returns the index of the maximum value in a given list. If there are multiple occurrences of the maximum value, return the index of its first occurrence.

### Example:
- Input: `[10, 20, 50, 40]`
- Output: `2` (index of `50`)

---

## Exercise 5: Reverse a list
Write a function that reverses the given list and returns it. The original list should remain unchanged.

### Example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Output: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`

---

## Exercise 6: Find common elements between two lists
Write a function that finds and returns the common elements between two lists. The result should be a new list containing these common elements. If there are no common elements, return an empty list.

### Example:
- Input: `list1 = [1, 2, 3]`, `list2 = [3, 4, 5]`
- Output: `[3]`

- Input: `list1 = [1, 2]`, `list2 = [3, 4]`
- Output: `[]`

---

## Exercise 7: Count occurrences of an element
Write a function that counts how many times a specified element appears in a given list and returns this count.

### Example:
- Input: `list = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, `element = 2`
- Output: `2`

---

## Exercise 8: Double each element in a list
Write a function that takes a list as input and returns a new list where each element is doubled.

### Example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Output: `[2, 4, 6]`

Good luck with these exercises! Remember to test your functions with different inputs to ensure they work correctly.
